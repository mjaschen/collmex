# Change Log

All notable changes to `mjaschen/collmex` will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
Updates should follow the [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/)
principles.

## [1.0.0]

**Warning: Backwards-compatibility-breaking changes**

### Changed

- increase the minimum required PHP version to 7.1
- *prod* dependencies for several used libraries are raised:
    - `"neitanod/forceutf8": "^2.0"`
    - `"symfony/finder": "^4.0"`
    - `"symfony/http-foundation": "^4.0"`
- all *dev* dependencies (except for PHPUnit) are required at their current major release
- upgrade to PHPUnit 7
- use strict comparisons where suitable
- use proper camelCase for all method names (`toJSON()` → `toJson()`, `getJSON()` → `getJson()`)
- use the `strict_types=1` execution directive globally
- use return type hints globally
- use method argument type hints globally (where suitable)
- introduced visibility declarations for all class constants (all constants in the *Type* classes were kept public)
- reduce the visibility of some `Response` methods
- Throw an exception if a Zip cannot be opened: `ZipArchive::open()` returns error codes on failure, not `false`
- change behaviour for invalid Zip responses: If a Zip response doesn't contain the CSV part, an
  `InvalidZipResponseException` is thrown as such a response is invalid
  regarding to the Collmex documentation. The previous behaviour was
  to silently accept such an invalid response and return `null`.
- Hard-code the CSV delimiter and enclosure: As the delimiter and enclosure are not subject to change for Collmex,
  they're hardcoded to reduce code complexity
- update the Collmex API Base URL

### Added

- added @oliverklee to `composer.json` as developer

### Removed

- drop LeagueParser, as `SimpleParser` works well enough for CSV files with current versions of PHP
- remove the deprecated FilterInterface::filter method, as this method has been deprecated in the past
- drop the parser parameter from the request constructor: there is only one parser here, and there is no need for this
  flexibility now.
- drop the generator parameter from the AbstractType constructor: now that there is only one generator,
  there is no need to be flexible about the kind of generator that is used.
